I like to eat broccoli and bananas.
I ate bananas and spinach smoothie for breakfast.
Chinchillas and kittens are cute.
My sister adopted kittens yesterday.
Look at this cute hamster munching on a piece of broccoli, how cute.
Wow, the broccoli and spinach smoothie tasted great!
My sister loves her chinchillas.
How cool would a kitten and a hamster eating a smoothie be.
